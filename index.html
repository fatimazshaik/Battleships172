<div class="abstract-title"><h2>Description</h2></div>
“Battleships!” is a the name of the project implemented for our EEC 172 final
project. This product is a recreation of the classic board game “Battleships”
on the CC3200 microcontroller. This game is a two player game where each 
player inputs their name on the micorntorller using a TV remote and then 
places their ships on a 6x6 board in a way that the other player can't see 
the opponents ship placement. Players will place small ships and medium sized ships. The medium ships will be rotatable. Afterwards, the players swaps boards 
and use the remote to try to attack the opponent's ship by selecting certain 
positions in the 6x6 board. When the player completed shooting the all the 
oppponents ships, the game is ober and the a message is sent over to AWS noting 
that that player won. For this project, the  game progress was displayed on an 
Adafruit OLED screen. Players could select ship positions using an AT&T Remote 
and a button on the board to rotate the ships. The game information was 
communicated via UART, and the winner information was sent to AWS.<br/><br/> Our source code can be

<h1 id="market-survey">Market Survey</h1>
<p>There are various similar product on the market. The main two products
we would like to highlight is the original "Battleship" board game and 
the mobile game version of Battleships that is avaiable on GamePigeon.
In the "Battleship" board game, is from popular board game company Hasbro. Two players use tokens and physical board to store ship location. On the other 
physical board, player takes turns attacking certain position until one player
finishes attacking all the opponent's ships. The other product is from the 
mobile game pack, GamePigeon. To play this game, one would need an iPhone
making it more expensive. However, it is fully automated. Compared to these 
two products, our product has teh advantage of being cheap and automated, 
suited for individuals of all age groups.</p>

    As shown in the system's diagram a player will be 
    As shown in the system flowchart, we use one of the CC3200 boards for
    the closed feedback loop for maintaining concentration in the
    environment. The board will read values with I2C protocol through an ADC
    which reads values from the thermistor and the TDS meter sensor. The
    board will also periodically read user-defined thresholds from the AWS
    cloud using RESTful APIs. When the sensory values read outside of the
    user-defined thresholds, the board will activate the motor control
    function to pump either water or nutrient solution to bring the
    concentration back within the thresholds. Meanwhile, another CC3200
    board is frequently reading from the AWS cloud to present the current
    TDS reading and user-defined threshold to the user on an OLED through
    SPI protocols. To adjust the thresholds, the user can either do it
    remotely or locally by using a TV remote to type the number into the IR
    receiver. The adjustments will be updated to the AWS and if the user
    updates remotely, the local CC3200 board will update the values in the
    next synchronization.

    Our system works based on the following state diagram. The device will
    periodically monitor the temperature and the electrical conductivity
    (EC) of the solution and convert the values into a TDS value using a
    calibration curve. At the same time, the device will check for threshold
    inputs, both over the AWS shadow and via manual input on the IR
    receiver. It will compare the TDS with the lower and upper thresholds
    set by the user. If the value is within the thresholds, it will stay in
    the rest state. If the TDS is higher than the upper thresholds, it will
    go to the water state and activate the water pump until the PPM is lower
    than the upper thresholds and go back to the rest state. If the PPM is
    lower than the lower thresholds, it will go to the nutrient state and
    activate the nutrient pump until the PPM is higher than the lower
    thresholds and go back to the rest state. In each state, the device will
    periodically post the TDS.

Board</h3>
<p>All game logic was controlled by a single CC3200 microcontroller. TI Cloud
Code Composer (ccs) was the IDE used to debug, build and upload C-code to the 
microntroller. The microntroller was in charge of decoding the IR signals
generated by the remote while recieveing and transmiting charcters over UART. 
Through parsing the IR signals, handling interrupts from the GPIO pins that are
associated to SW3 and the pin associated to the IR pin, the micontroller was 
able to recieve user input. Meanwhile the OLED and AWS worked togetehr to provide a visual cue to show what was going on in the game.</p>

    At the end of the game, when the endgame screen is reached,
    the player that won is sent to AWS using their Internet of
    Things device/shadow feature. Specifically, the SNS feature
    and the http post function was used. We created an SNS
    topic and a subscription with an EMAIL protocol. Next, we
    created a new rule that attached an action when the rule was
    triggered. Finally, we simply called the http post function with
    the player name and the result of the game.

    In order to receive signals from the AT&T remote, there were
    multiple steps that had to be taken in previous labs to set
    up a foundation. First, we built an application circuit for the
    IR receiver. By doing this, an effective low pass filter is
    built which can eliminate unnecessary noise. The output of the 
    circuit is connected to a GPIO pin. The GPIO pin was ableto capture
    the signals from pressing a button on a remote. Using an a interrupt 
    handler associated to that pin, we set a flag high. Once when the flag is set to high, portions of our code is ran, like changing the position of 
    ship or typing a user's name.

    Then, when the flag for the button being pushed went high,
    the flag is checked in the main function and the ship is rotated
    accordingly.</div>

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>

<p>The most two significant challenges faced during the project development
  was (1) UART Buffer Size and (2) Board-to-Board Communication. These two
  problems are related to using UART with the microcontrollers.</p>

<h2 id="uart-buffer-size">UART Buffer Size</h2>
<p>The first problem we encountered was the size of the buffer of UARTA1. The core of our game logic relied on using a 2D array to digitally represent the state of the game. The rationale behind this design choice was that when a user attacks a position on the board, a 2D array provides an easy and fast way to check if the attack is a successful hit or not (taking O(1) time). This feature worked seamlessly with the rest of our logic, but since we couldn't send a 2D array over UART, our TA instructed us to use an algorithm to convert the 2D array into a string. Despite doing this, UART couldn't transmit every element in the string. Out of the 36 elements in the string, UART was only successfully sending 15 elements. After troubleshooting this problem, we discovered that UARTA1 had a buffer size of 15 characters. Thus, we decided that instead of sending the entire array, we would send the coordinates or single characters when necessary.</p>

<h2 id="board-to-board-communication">Board-to-Board Communication</h2>
<p>The main issue encountered was implementing board to board communication to
 enforce a turn-based system for the game. The initial plan was to implement
 this feature by using UART to connect the transmitter pin of the first
 microcontroller to the receiver pin of the second microcontroller, and vice
 versa. However, when doing this, we faced significant noise and random
 characters transmitted over the lines, which disrupted communication and 
 resulted in incorrect messages being sent over. Unfortunately, this issue
 wasn't identified until later in this project, when tested the code with two
 microcontrollers. Since this testing wasn't done until later in the timeline
 we weren't able to resolve this issue in time for checkoff. As a workaround,
 we modified the project so that messages were sent to a single
 microcontroller, requiring players to exchange microcontrollers after placing
 their ship positions.</p>

<h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
<p>If there had been more time, we would have implemented these three additional
  features: (1) completing the two-board communication, (2)
  incorporating audio cues, and (3) enabling user input via an analog stick.
  Completing the two-board communication feature would enforce a turn-based
  system, ensuring players follow the rules. The second feature, audio cues
  would involve connecting a piezo or a buzzer that would play a sound when a
  ship has been attacked, a feature from the original game. Lastly, using an
  analog stick would enhance and simplify user movement.</p>
