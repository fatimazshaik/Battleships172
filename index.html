<div class="abstract-title"><h2>Description</h2></div>
“Battleships!” is a the name of the project implemented for our EEC 172 final
project. This product is a recreation of the classic board game “Battleships”
on the CC3200 microcontroller. This game is a two player game where each 
player inputs their name on the micorntorller using a TV remote and then 
places their ships on a 6x6 board in a way that the other player can't see 
the opponents ship placement. Players will place small ships and medium sized ships. The medium ships will be rotatable. Afterwards, the players swaps boards 
and use the remote to try to attack the opponent's ship by selecting certain 
positions in the 6x6 board. When the player completed shooting the all the 
oppponents ships, the game is ober and the a message is sent over to AWS noting 
that that player won. For this project, the  game progress was displayed on an 
Adafruit OLED screen. Players could select ship positions using an AT&T Remote 
and a button on the board to rotate the ships. The game information was 
communicated via UART, and the winner information was sent to AWS.<br/><br/> Our source code can be

<h1 id="market-survey">Market Survey</h1>
<p>There are various similar product on the market. The main two products
we would like to highlight is the original "Battleship" board game and 
the mobile game version of Battleships that is avaiable on GamePigeon.
In the "Battleship" board game, is from popular board game company Hasbro. Two players use tokens and physical board to store ship location. On the other 
physical board, player takes turns attacking certain position until one player
finishes attacking all the opponent's ships. The other product is from the 
mobile game pack, GamePigeon. To play this game, one would need an iPhone
making it more expensive. However, it is fully automated. Compared to these 
two products, our product has teh advantage of being cheap and automated, 
suited for individuals of all age groups.</p>

    As shown in the system flowchart, we use one of the CC3200 boards for
    the closed feedback loop for maintaining concentration in the
    environment. The board will read values with I2C protocol through an ADC
    which reads values from the thermistor and the TDS meter sensor. The
    board will also periodically read user-defined thresholds from the AWS
    cloud using RESTful APIs. When the sensory values read outside of the
    user-defined thresholds, the board will activate the motor control
    function to pump either water or nutrient solution to bring the
    concentration back within the thresholds. Meanwhile, another CC3200
    board is frequently reading from the AWS cloud to present the current
    TDS reading and user-defined threshold to the user on an OLED through
    SPI protocols. To adjust the thresholds, the user can either do it
    remotely or locally by using a TV remote to type the number into the IR
    receiver. The adjustments will be updated to the AWS and if the user
    updates remotely, the local CC3200 board will update the values in the
    next synchronization.

    Our system works based on the following state diagram. The device will
    periodically monitor the temperature and the electrical conductivity
    (EC) of the solution and convert the values into a TDS value using a
    calibration curve. At the same time, the device will check for threshold
    inputs, both over the AWS shadow and via manual input on the IR
    receiver. It will compare the TDS with the lower and upper thresholds
    set by the user. If the value is within the thresholds, it will stay in
    the rest state. If the TDS is higher than the upper thresholds, it will
    go to the water state and activate the water pump until the PPM is lower
    than the upper thresholds and go back to the rest state. If the PPM is
    lower than the lower thresholds, it will go to the nutrient state and
    activate the nutrient pump until the PPM is higher than the lower
    thresholds and go back to the rest state. In each state, the device will
    periodically post the TDS.

Board</h3>
<p>All control and logic was handled by two CC3200 microcontroller
units, one each for the Master and Slave device. On the master device,
it was responsible for decoding IR inputs from the remote to allow the
user to input thresholds to be sent over AWS. The board’s SPI
functionality, using the TI SPI library, was used to interface with the
OLED display. The MCU is WiFi enabled, allowing a remote connection
between the two boards.</p>
<p>On the slave device, the microcontroller was responsible for the same
functionalities as above, in addition to the TDS reading and control.
This includes interfacing with the ADC over the I2C bus, reading
thresholds over HTTP from the AWS device shadow, writing the reported
TDS to the device shadow, and activating the two pumps using the BJT
control circuit.</p>

    The AWS IoT core allows our devices to communicate with each other
    asynchronously. The master device can update the desired thresholds, and
    the slave device will read them and synchronize them to the reported
    state. The slave device will also post the TDS and temperature readings
    periodically.

    On both the Master and Slave devices, a user can input the TDS

    with a carrier frequency of 38KHz. The Vishay IR receiver is connected
    to Pin 62 of the CC3200, which is configured as a GPIO input pin. Each
    positive edge of the signal triggers an interrupt in the main program,
    storing the pulse distances into a buffer, and allowing us to decode the
    inputs (1-9, delete and enter). The IR receiver is connected to VCC
    through a resistor and a capacitor to filter any ripples.

    The outputs from the thermistor and TDS sensor board are
    in the form of analog voltages, which need to be converted to digital
    values to be usable in our program. We chose the AD1015 breakout board
    from Adafruit, which sports 4-channels and 12 bits of precision. We
    ended up using only 2 channels, so there is a potential for even more
    cost savings. The ADC board supports I2C communication, which we can use
    to request and read the two channel voltages.

    Conductivity-based TDS measurements are sensitive to temperature. To
    allow accurate TDS measurements in a variety of climates and seasons,
    temperature compensation calculations must be performed. To measure the
    temperature, we use an NTC thermistor connected in a voltage divider
    with a 10k resistor. The voltage across the resistor is read by the ADC
    and converted to temperature using the equation provided by the
    thermistor datasheet.

    In our first attempt to measure TDS, we used a simple two-probe analog
    setup with a voltage divider. We soon found out that this was a naïve
    approach (see Challenges). Consequently, we acquired a specialty TDS
    sensing board from CQRobot, which generates a sinusoidal pulse and
    measures the voltage drop to give a highly precise voltage to the ADC.
    The MCU can then convert this voltage to a TDS value using the equation
    provided by the device datasheet. We calibrated the TDS readings using a
    standalone TDS sensor pen. After calibration and setting up the curves
    for temperature compensation, we were able to achieve TDS readings
    accurate to within 5% of the TDS sensor pen.

    The CC3200 is unable to provide sufficient power to drive the pumps,
    which need 100mA of current each. Therefore, we used an external power
    source in the form of 2 AA batteries for each pump motor. To allow the
    CC3200 to turn on/off the motors, we designed a simple amplifier using a
    Common Emitter topology. When the control pin is asserted HIGH, the BJT
    will allow current to flow from 3V to ground through the pump motor.
    Conversely, if the control signal is LOW, the BJT will not allow current
    to flow in the motor. For each motor, there is a reverse-biased diode
    connected across it. This protects our circuit from current generated by
    the motor if it is spun from external force or inertia.

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>The most two significant challenges faced during the project development
  was (1) UART Buffer Size and (2) Board-to-Board Communication. These two
  problems are related to using UART with the microcontrollers.</p>
<h2 id="probe-channel-polarization">UART Buffer Size</h2>
<p>The first problem we encountered was the size of the buffer of UARTA1. The core of our game logic relied on using a 2D array to digitally represent the state of the game. The rationale behind this design choice was that when a user attacks a position on the board, a 2D array provides an easy and fast way to check if the attack is a successful hit or not (taking O(1) time). This feature worked seamlessly with the rest of our logic, but since we couldn't send a 2D array over UART, our TA instructed us to use an algorithm to convert the 2D array into a string. Despite doing this, UART couldn't transmit every element in the string. Out of the 36 elements in the string, UART was only successfully sending 15 elements. After troubleshooting this problem, we discovered that UARTA1 had a buffer size of 15 characters. Thus, we decided that instead of sending the entire array, we would send the coordinates or single characters when necessary.</p>
<h2 id="current-limitation-of-gpio-pins">Board-to-Board Communication</h2>
<p>The main issue encountered was implementing board to board communication to
 enforce a turn-based system for the game. The initial plan was to implement
 this feature by using UART to connect the transmitter pin of the first
 microcontroller to the receiver pin of the second microcontroller, and vice
 versa. However, when doing this, we faced significant noise and random
 characters transmitted over the lines, which disrupted communication and 
 resulted in incorrect messages being sent over. Unfortunately, this issue
 wasn't identified until later in this project, when tested the code with two
 microcontrollers. Since this testing wasn't done until later in the timeline
 we weren't able to resolve this issue in time for checkoff. As a workaround,
 we modified the project so that messages were sent to a single
 microcontroller, requiring players to exchange microcontrollers after placing
 their ship positions.</p>
<h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
<p>If there had been more time, we would have implemented these three additional
  features: (1) completing the two-board communication, (2)
  incorporating audio cues, and (3) enabling user input via an analog stick.
  Completing the two-board communication feature would enforce a turn-based
  system, ensuring players follow the rules. The second feature, audio cues
  would involve connecting a piezo or a buzzer that would play a sound when a
  ship has been attacked, a feature from the original game. Lastly, using an
  analog stick would enhance and simplify user movement.</p>
